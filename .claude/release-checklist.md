- [ ] Test coverage meets target (>80%, currently ~100%)
- [ ] **Check `.gitignore` file**: Review and update if recent changes require ignoring additional files/directories

## Version & Documentation Updates

- [ ] **Determine version number** following semantic versioning:
  - Patch (0.x.Y): Bug fixes, minor improvements, dependency updates
  - Minor (0.X.0): New features, new options, backward compatible changes
  - Major (X.0.0): Breaking changes (rarely needed for this node)

- [ ] **Update README.md Version History**:
  - Change `### 0.X.0 (Upcoming)` to `### 0.X.0` with no date suffix
  - Add comprehensive bullet points describing all changes
  - Categorize changes:
    - New features and capabilities
    - Bug fixes and improvements
    - Dependency updates
    - Breaking changes (if any)
    - Security fixes (if any)

  - Ensure all new features are documented in Usage section
  - Update configuration options if new parameters added
  - Verify code examples are accurate

  - Design documents in openspec/changes/ (if architectural changes)

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Run full test suite**: `npm test`

## Commit & Version Bump

**IMPORTANT:** Commit README.md changes BEFORE running `npm version`

  ```
  - Pre-commit hook will run: lint â†’ test â†’ build automatically

- [ ] **Bump version with npm** (creates commit + tag automatically):
  ```bash
  npm version patch   # for 0.x.Y (bug fixes)
  npm version minor   # for 0.X.0 (new features)
  npm version major   # for X.0.0 (breaking changes)
  ```
  - This updates package.json and package-lock.json
  - Creates git commit: "X.Y.Z"
  - Creates git tag: "vX.Y.Z"

## Publishing to npm

- [ ] **Verify prepublishOnly will succeed**:
  ```bash
  npm run prepublishOnly
  ```
  - Runs: build + lint + test
  - All must pass or publish will fail

- [ ] **Publish to npm**:
  ```bash
  npm publish
  ```
  - Automatically runs prepublishOnly hook
  - Publishes `dist/` directory to npm registry
  - Package appears at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@michaelvanlaar/n8n-nodes-defuddle

- [ ] **Verify npm publication** (1-2 minutes after publish):
  - Visit: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@michaelvanlaar/n8n-nodes-defuddle
  - Confirm new version number is displayed
  - Check README renders correctly on npm page
  - Verify last publish time is recent

## Push to GitHub

- [ ] **Push commits and tags to GitHub**:
  ```bash
  git push && git push --tags
  ```
  - Pushes the version commit created by `npm version`
  - Pushes the vX.Y.Z tag

- [ ] **Verify GitHub push**:
  - Visit: https://github.com/MichaelvanLaar/n8n-nodes-defuddle
  - Confirm new commit appears
  - Check tag appears in tags list

## GitHub Release

- [ ] **Create GitHub release with changelog**:
  ```bash
  gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
  ## Changes

  - [Copy bullet points from README.md version history]
  - [Use exact same text for consistency]

## Post-Release Verification

- [ ] **Test installation from npm**:

  - Open n8n instance
  - Go to Settings > Community Nodes
  - Install: `@michaelvanlaar/n8n-nodes-defuddle`
  - Verify installation succeeds
  - Confirm node appears in n8n node palette

- [ ] **Smoke test in n8n**:
  - Create workflow: HTTP Request â†’ Defuddle

  - Verify output is correct
  - Test at least one of each: HTML only, Markdown only, Both

- [ ] **Update project tracking** (if applicable):
  - Close issues fixed in this release
  - Update project milestones
  - Archive completed OpenSpec changes: `openspec archive <change-id>`

- [ ] **Announce release** (optional):
  - n8n Community Forum: https://community.n8n.io/
  - GitHub Discussions (if enabled)
  - Social media for significant releases

## Rollback Procedure (if needed)

If critical issues are discovered after publishing:

1. **Deprecate broken version on npm**:
   ```bash
   npm deprecate @michaelvanlaar/n8n-nodes-defuddle@X.Y.Z "Critical bug - use version X.Y.Z+1 instead"
   ```

2. **Delete GitHub release** (optional):
   ```bash
   gh release delete vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Create hotfix**:
   - Fix the critical issue
   - Follow this checklist again for patch release (X.Y.Z+1)
   - Note the fix in version history

**Note:** Cannot unpublish from npm after 72 hours. Use deprecation instead.

npm run build         # Build for production

# Release workflow (in order)
git add README.md     # Stage documentation
git commit -m "..."   # Commit documentation updates
npm version minor     # Bump version (patch/minor/major)

```

## Version Number Guide

- **Minor** (0.3.0): New features, new options, new output fields, backward compatible
- **Major** (1.0.0): Breaking changes, removed features, API changes (rare for this node)

## Important Notes

- **Pre-commit hooks** run lint â†’ test â†’ build before every commit (via Husky)
- **prepublishOnly hook** runs build + lint + test before publishing to npm
- **All 47 tests must pass** before release (enforced by hooks)
- **README.md must be updated BEFORE `npm version`** (npm version creates commit automatically)
- Use **same changelog text** in README.md and GitHub release for consistency
- Follow **semantic versioning**: https://semver.org/
- Update version history **throughout development**, not just at release time
- Package requires **Node.js 20+** and **n8n 1.20.0+**
- Only **`dist/` directory** is published to npm (configured in package.json `files`)
- **Review `.gitignore`** before each release to ensure proper file exclusion

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All 47 tests must pass
- **Coverage**: >80% (currently ~100%)
- **Linting**: Zero errors (n8n community node rules + TypeScript ESLint)
- **Build**: Clean build with no warnings
- **Manual Testing**: Test in actual n8n instance before publishing

This project uses:
- **Jest** for testing
- **ts-jest** for TypeScript support in tests
- **Husky** for Git hooks
